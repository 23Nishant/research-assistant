# Research Paper Search Interface

This project is a Python-based interface designed to search and retrieve optimized results from research papers.
 The interface leverages the power of the OpenAI API, along with several other Python libraries and tools like `axios` and `xml2js`,
 to provide users with high-quality, relevant results.

## Features

- **Search Topics:** Input a topic and retrieve optimized search results from research papers.
- **Integration with OpenAI API:** Utilize OpenAI's natural language processing capabilities for enhanced search optimization.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Uses `axios` and `xml2js` to fetch and parse data efficiently.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simplifies the process of searching and navigating through research papers.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- **Python:** Core language for building the application.
- **OpenAI API:** Used for intelligent processing and optimization of search results.

### Libraries & Tools
- **Axios:** Handles HTTP requests to fetch data from external sources.
- **xml2js:** Parses XML data into JSON format for easier manipulation.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

## Usage

1. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

2. Access the interface:
   - If it's a web-based app, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` (or the specified port).

3. Enter a topic in the search bar and view optimized results for research papers.
